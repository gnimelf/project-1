# Brew Chasers

## Description

Hi, we’re the creators of Beer Chasers. We created an easy to use website that’ll helps beer lovers find all the coolest breweries near them. Not only will this be useful for our users, but it will also support the local breweries gain visibility that they may not have had before. We have lots of great ideas for future development, so we hope you’ll see how beneficial we’ll be for the brewing community.
